# 0003-VerilogAsm-65C816S

This repository will hold the Verilog and Assembly language codes for project 0002; using the WDC 65C816S.

The Verilog code will be written within [Xilinx's ISE14.x WebPack](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html)
 and assembly code assembled with the [ACME assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/).
